Overcoming the language barrier in the Indian sub - continent is a very challenging task . Sampark _CITE_ is an effort in this direction .

Besides the common features used in traditional Named Entity Recognition ( NER ) systems , we also utilize extensive external resources to build various name lists and word clusters . Following the traditional BIO scheme used in sequential labeling , we assign a label for each word in the sentence , where “ B - TERM ” indicates the start of an aspect term , “ I - TERM ” indicates the continuation of an aspect term , and “ O ” indicates not an aspect term . All sentences are tokenized and parsed using the Stanford Parser _CITE_ . The parsing information is used to extract various syntactic features ( e . g . POS , head word , dependency relation ) described in the next section .__label__Method|Tool|Use

Assembly starts from aligned DNA - Seq reads to reconstruct the original DNA sequence computationally , which generates large , continuous regions of DNA sequence [ 3 ]. Many alignment software provide tools to perform the assembly after the read alignment ( e . g ., MAQ ), or standalone resources can be used ( SAMTOOLS [ 13 ], Emboss [ 14 ]) or commercial packages like Geneious ( _CITE_ ) and CLC - Bio ( http :// www . clcbio . com ). For organisms without a sequenced reference genome , it is not possible to perform any reference genome guided assembly of the reads , thus de novo assembly is always an essential step for data analysis . The majority of de novo assemblers that have been released follow two basic approaches : overlap graphs [ 15 ] and de Bruijn graphs [ 16 ].__label__Method|Tool|Use

While the SBDG immediately serves the well - defined area of X - ray crystallography , our pilot project has demonstrated that our infrastructure can preserve additional data types , such as decoy data sets for NMR computations or MicroED data sets . SBDG will duplicate XFEL data sets that are currently accessible through the Coherent X - ray Imaging Data Bank ( _CITE_ ) and support their distribution by DAA . In addition , SBDG will collaborate with MicroED and XFEL collection curators who will moderate development of community driven efforts to automate data analysis pipelines to parallel automatic processing of X - ray diffraction data sets with packages like DIALS or xia2 .

The output layer is a SoftMax classifier that predicts , after the “ GO ” symbol is read , one of the following three labels : 1 , if a word is to be retained in the compression , 0 if a word is to be deleted , or EOS , which is the output label used for the “ GO ” input and the end - of - sentence final period . Input representation : In the simplest implementation , that we call LSTM , the input layer has 259 dimensions . The first 256 contain the embedding - vector representation of the current in put word , pre - trained using the Skipgram model _CITE_ ( Mikolov et al ., 2013 ). The final three dimensions contain a one - hot - spot representation of the goldstandard label of the previous word ( during training ), or the generated label of the previous word ( during decoding ).

When the network is updated according to ( 1 ), then under certain conditions the network state becomes asymptotically independent of initial conditions . More precisely , if the network is started from two arbitrary states x ( 0 ), 31 ( 0 ) and is run with the same input sequence in both cases , the resulting state sequences x ( n ), x ( n ) converge to each other . If this condition holds , the reservoir network state will asymptotically depend only on the input history , and the network tained in a tutorial Mathematica notebook which can be fetched from _CITE_ is said to be an echo state network ( ESN ). A sufficient condition for the echo state property is contractivity of W . In practice it was found that a weaker condition suffices , namely , to ensure that the spectral radius Amax of W is less than unity .__label__Supplement|Document|Produce
