For example videos of these systems , see the Supplementary Material or visit ( _CITE_ ). One limitation of the above systems is that the positions , masses , and radii of all objects are either visually observable in every frame or global constants . Furthermore , while occlusion is allowed , the objects have the same radius so total occlusion never occurs .__label__Supplement|Media|Produce
It may be noted that though both ReadDepth and CBS in iCopyDAV uses the same segmentation approach , the performance of CBS is better than ReadDepth for sequencing coverage & lt ; 40 × due to the difference in data pre - treatment approaches in two cases . From the comparison of recall and precision values of CBS and TVM in iCopyDAV with the three DoC - based tools , we observe higher recall with both TVM and CBS approaches for the detection of CNVs & lt ; 1 Kb , while for the detection of CNVs > 1 Kb all the DoC - based methods showed recall values approaching ‘ 1 ’ with increase in sequencing coverage ( S3 ( A ) Fig ). The precision ~ 1 with both CBS and TVM in the detection of small and large CNVs PLOS ONE | _CITE_ April 5 , 2018 16 / 37 iCopyDAV : Integrated platform for detection , annotation and visualization of copy number variations ( even at 5x sequencing coverage for TVM ), while precision values ( combined of small and large CNVs ) of ReadDepth , CNVnator , and Control - FREEC are — 0 . 71 , — 0 . 51 and — 0 . 26 , respectively , at 30x coverage ( S4 ( B ) Fig ). Also , it is observed that in case of ReadDepth and Control - FREEC , a reduction in precision is observed with increase in sequencing depth due to increase in the number of false positives . This clearly indicates the importance of appropriate normalization of read depth signals .__label__Supplement|Paper|Introduce
In some settings , the λ that yields the best generalization error scales like O ( 1 / Vn ), hence p = O ( Tr ( K )/ Vn ) is sufficient . On the other hand , if the columns are sampled uniformly , one would get p = O ( dmof ) = O ( n maxi li ( λ )). We test our results based on several datasets : one synthetic regression problem from [ 3 ] to illustrate the importance of the λ - ridge leverage scores , the Pumadyn family consisting of three datasets pumadyn - 32fm , pumadyn - 32fh and pumadyn - 32nh _CITE_ and the Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset from the UCI database . The synthetic case consists of a regression problem on the interval X = [ 0 , 1 ] where , given a sequence ( xi ) 1 ≤ i ≤ n and a sequence of noise ( Ei ) 1 ≤ i ≤ n , we observe the sequence The function f belongs to the RKHS F generated by the kernel k ( x , y ) = 1 ( 2β )! B2β ( x − y − Lx − yI ) where B2β is the 2β - th Bernoulli polynomial [ 3 ]. One important feature of this regression problem is the distribution of the points ( xi ) 1 ≤ i ≤ n on the interval X : if they are spread uniformly over the interval , the λ - ridge leverage scores ( li ( λ )) 1 ≤ i ≤ n are uniform for every λ & gt ; 0 , and uniform column sampling is optimal in this case .__label__Material|Data|Use

As summary generation is time consuming task ( DUC _CITE_ only used 25 summaries to evaluate the performance of systems ), we picked 100 positive and 100 negative reviews randomly from the dataset and their abstract summaries are generated manually with 200 words limit as budget for evaluation . These 200 summaries are used as gold standard for estimating ROUGE scores of system generated summaries .

Finally , our third claim is that data programming is an intuitive and productive framework for domain - expert users , and we report on our initial user studies . Relation Mention Extraction Tasks In the relation mention extraction task , our objects are relation mention candidates x = ( e1 , e2 ), which are pairs of entity mentions e1 , e2 in unstructured text , and our goal is to learn a model that classifies each candidate as either a true textual assertion of the relation R ( e1 , e2 ) or not . We examine a news application from the 2014 TAC - KBP Slot Filling challenge _CITE_ , where we extract relations between real - world entities from articles [ 2 ]; a clinical genomics application , where we extract causal relations between genetic mutations and phenotypes from the scientific literature ; and a pharmacogenomics application where we extract interactions between genes , also from the scientific literature [ 21 ]; further details are included in the Appendix . For each application , we or our collaborators originally built a system where a training set was programmatically generated by ordering the labeling functions as a sequence of if - then - return statements , and for each candidate , taking the first label emitted by this script as the training label . We refer to this as the if - then - return ( ITR ) approach , and note that it often required significant domain expert development time to tune ( weeks or more ).__label__Method|Algorithm|Extent

The matrix O is initialized as follows : ∀ i = 1 .. ml and ∀ Q in {− 1 , 1 }, Oσi = 1 if Q = yi , 0 otherwise , ∀ i = ml + 1 .. mu and ∀ Q in {− 1 , 1 }, Oσi = 0 . 5 and we learn an optimal separator : Here c1 and c2 are balance constants between the labeled and unlabeled set : when the number of unlabeled instances become greater than the number of labeled instances , we need to reduce the importance of the unlabeled set in the learning procedure because there exists the risk that the labeled set will be ignored . We consider the provided labels to be correct , so we keep the corresponding lO fixed during the iterations of the algorithm and estimate uO by optimizing P2 ( Xu , ht + ). The iterative algorithm with O - SVM is implemented in Python using Cvxopt ( for optimizing O - SVM ) and Cvxpy _CITE_ with its Ecos solver [ 9 ]. For each dataset , we show in Figure 1 the accuracy of the two methods with an increasing proportion of labeled data . The different approaches are compared on the same kernel , either the linear or the gaussian , the one that gives higher overall accuracy .__label__Method|Tool|Use

We call this model Relgrams , as it can be seen as a relational analog to the n - grams language model . We extract relational triples from each sentence in a large corpus using the OLLIE Open IE system ( Mausam et al ., 2012 ). _CITE_ This provides relational tuples in the format ( Arg1 , Relation , Arg2 ) where each tuple element is a phrase from the sentence . The sentence “ He cited a new study that was released by UCLA in 2008 .” produces three tuples : Relational triples provide a more specific representation which is less ambiguous when compared to ( subj , verb ) or ( verb , obj ) pairs . However , using relational triples also increases sparsity .__label__Method|Tool|Use

The indicated p - values for pair - wise comparison are calculated using Mann - Whitney Utest , n = 60 alleles for each interrogated locus . The distances between the centres of the regions covered by the probes D and E ( located in the gene poor TADs 2 and 5 respectively ) are similar to the much closer regions covered by the probes B and C ( located in the adjacent gene - rich TAD3 and TAD4 ). _CITE_ Correction of the 5C data for non - biological biases associated with this technology was performed as described previously [ 17 , 43 ] ( see Materials and Methods for details ) ( S2 – S5 Figs ).

Graphs have long been used to describe linguistic annotations , most familiarly in the form of trees ( a graph in which each node has a single parent ) for syntactic annotation . Annotation Graphs ( Bird and Liberman , 2001 ) have been widely used to represent layers of annotation , each associated with primary data , although the concept was not extended to allow for annotations linked to other annotations and thus to consider multiple annotations as a single graph . More recently , the Penn Discourse TreeBank released its annotations of the Penn TreeBank as a graph , accompanied by an API that provides a set of standard graphhandling functions for query and access _CITE_ . The graph model therefore seems to be gaining ground as a natural and flexible model for linguistic annotations which , as we demonstrate below , can repre LAF provides a general framework for representing annotations that has been described elsewhere in detail ( Ide and Romary , 2004 , 2006 ).

Another improvement will come with the use of absent phenotypes .

We refer to this problem as selective labeling , in contrast to conventional random labeling . To achieve the goal of selective labeling , it is crucial to consider the out - of - sample error of a specific learner .

( 2002 ), who define MWEs as : different but related phenomena [ which ] can be described as a sequence of words that acts as a single unit at some level of linguistic analysis . This generic and intentionally vague definition can be narrowed down according to the application needs . For example , for the statistical machine translation ( MT ) system _CITE_ used in the examples shown in Table 1 , an MWE is any sequence of words which , when not translated as a unit , generates errors : ungrammatical or unnatural verbal constructions ( sentence 1 ), awkward literal translations of idioms ( sentence 2 ) and problems of lexical choice and word order in specialised texts ( sentence 3 ). These examples illustrate the importance of correctly dealing with MWEs in MT applications and , more generally , MWEs can speed up and help remove ambiguities in many current NLP applications , for example : Despite the importance of MWEs in several applications , they are often neglected in the design and construction of real - life systems . In 1993 , Smadja pointed out that “... although disambiguation was originally considered as a performance task , the collocations retrieved have not been used for any specific computational task .” Most of the recent and current research in the MWE community still focuses on MWE acquisition instead of integration of automatically acquired or manually compiled resources into applications .__label__Method|Tool|Introduce

A current research interest concerns consistency of performance across different domains . From our experiments , we show that monolingual segmenters cannot produce consistently good results when applied to a new domain . Our pilot investigation into the influence of word segmentation on SMT involves three offthe - shelf Chinese word segmenters including ICTCLAS ( ICT ) Olympic version _CITE_ , LDC segmenter and Stanford segmenter version 2006 - 0511 . Both ICTCLAS and Stanford segmenters utilise machine learning techniques , with Hidden Markov Models for ICT ( Zhang et al ., 2003 ) and conditional random fields for the Stanford segmenter ( Tseng et al ., 2005 ). Both segmentation models were trained on news domain data with named entity recognition functionality .__label__Method|Tool|Use
Since we are extracting predicate - argument structure , syntactic variations such as passive constructions and relative clauses will be all ‘ normalized ’ into the same form . Consequently , ‘ the book which I read ’, ‘ I read the book ’, and ‘ the book was read by me ’ will form the exact same semantic tuple & lt ; I , read , the book , N / A , N / A >. The resulting tuple structures along with their associated text are stored in an Apache Solr / Lucene _CITE_ server which receives queries from the Searchbench user interface . The Searchbench user interface ( UI ) is a web application running in every modern , JavaScript - enabled web browser . As can be seen in Figure 4 , the UI is divided into three parts : ( 1 ) a sidebar on the left ( Filters View ), where different filters can be set that constrain the list of found documents ; ( 2 ) a list of found documents matching the currently set filters in the upper right part of the UI ( Results View ); ( 3 ) the Document View in the lower right part of the UI with different views of the current document .__label__Supplement|Website|Use
We trained the linear multiclass model of Section 3 with the following alternative methods : exact softmax training ( SOFT ), the onevs - each bound ( OVE ), the stochastically optimized one - vs - each bound ( OVE - SGD ) and Bouchard ’ s bound ( BOUCHARD ). For all approaches , the associated cost function was maximized together with an added regularization penalty term , − 2A || w || , which ensures that the global maximum of the cost function is achieved for finite w . Since we want to investigate how well we surrogate exact softmax training , we used the same fixed value A = 1 in all experiments . We considered three small scale multiclass classification datasets : MNIST _CITE_ , 20NEWS and BIBTEX [ 12 ]; see Table 1 for details . Notice that BIBTEX is originally a multi - label classification dataset [ 2 ]. where each example may have more than one labels .__label__Material|Data|Use
Therefore , we suspect that DMV training assigns an increased amount of probability mass to dependency paths along structures which are truly related to these relations . We used the DMV implementation from Cohen and Smith ( 2009 ) 4 . For the supervised Nivre arc - eager parser we used MALT ( Nivre et al ., 2007 ) with a pre - trained Penn Treebank ( Marcus et al ., 1993 ) model _CITE_ . As a baseline , we tested left branching parses i . e . dependency trees solely consisting of head - todependent edges from the right to the left .__label__Method|Algorithm|Use
This quantity is an estimate of type - I error under H0 , and corresponds to test power when H1 is true . We set α = 0 . 01 in all the experiments . All the code and preprocessed data are available at _CITE_ Optimization The parameter tuning objective ˆλtrn / 2 ( θ ) is a function of θ consisting of one real - valued σ and J test locations each of d dimensions . The parameters θ can thus be regarded as a Jd + 1 Euclidean vector .__label__Material|Data|Produce
