Unfortunately , the syntactic annotation scheme of the Negra treebank ( Skut et al ., 1997 ), which omits all projections that are not strictly necessary to determine the constituent structure of a sentence , is not very well suited for automatic extraction tasks . So far , we have only been able to extract adjective + noun pairs . We plan to use the TIGERSearch tool _CITE_ in combination with stylesheets to obtain reference data for PP + verb and noun + verb pairs .

In ( Bunt , 2006 ); ( Bunt and Girard , 2005 ) a dimension in dialogue act analysis is defined as an aspect ofparticipating in dialogue which can be addressed : The independence of dimensions , required by this definition , has the effect that an utterance may have a function in one dimension independent of the functions that it may have in other dimensions , and helps to explain why utterances may have multiple functions . Moreover , it leads to more manageable and more adaptable annotation schemas ( compared to , for instance , DAMSL and its derivatives ), since it allows annotators to leave out certain dimensions that they are not interested in , or to extend the schema with additional dimensions ; and it allows restricting or modifying the set of tags in a particular dimension without affecting the rest of the schema . Based on the above definition and extensive theoretical and empirical studies , 10 dimensions are defined in the DIT ++ dialogue act annotation scheme _CITE_ : the domain or task / activity ( Task ); feedback on the processing of previous utterances by the speaker ( Auto - feedback ) or by other interlocutors ( Allofeedback ); managing difficulties in the speaker ’ s utterance production ( Own - Communication Management , OCM ) or that of other interlocutors ( Partner Communication Management , PCM ); the speaker ’ s need for time to continue the dialogue ( Time Management ); establishing and maintaining contact ( Contact Management ); the allocation of the next turn ( Turn Management ); the way the speaker is planning to structure the dialogue ( Dialogue Structuring ); and attention for social aspects of the interaction ( Social Obligations Management , SOM ). This paper investigates the independence of these ten dimensions . In Section 2 we discuss the notion of independence of dimensions and how it can be tested .__label__Method|Algorithm|Use

On the other hand , in the sentence ( B ), the expression simply corresponds to a literal concatenation of the usages of the constituents : the post - positional particle “ に ( ni )” and the verb “ ついて ( tsuite )”, and has a content word meaning “ follow ”. Therefore , when considering machine translation of those Japanese sentences into English , it is necessary to precisely judge the usage of the compound expression “ に ( ni ) ついて ( tsuite )”, as shown in the English translation of the two sentences in Table 1 . There exist widely - used Japanese text processing tools , i . e ., pairs of a morphological analysis tool and a subsequent parsing tool , such as JUMAN + KNP and ChaSen + CaboCha _CITE_ .

The main difficulty encountered related to the distinction required between proper and common nouns , the morphological boundary between the two being unclear in those fields where common nouns are often reclassified as “ proper nouns ”, as is demonstrated by the presence of these names ( Tanabe et al ., 2005 ) notes that “ a more detailed definition of a gene / protein name , as well as additional annotation rules , could improve inter - annotator agreement and help solve some of the tagging inconsistencies ”. in nomenclatures ( small , acid - soluble spore protein A is an extreme case ) or acronymisation phenomena ( one finds for example across the outer membrane ( OM )). In those cases , annotators were instructed to refer to official lists , such as SwissProt _CITE_ , which requires a significant amount of time . Delimiting the boundaries of the elements to be annotated also raised many questions . One can thus choose to annotate nifh messenger RNA if it is considered that the mention of the state messenger RNA is part of the determination of the reference , or only nifh , if it is considered that the proper noun is enough to build the determination .__label__Supplement|Document|Use

It has long been recognized in the image processing community that wavelet transforms form an excellent basis for representation of images . Within the class of linear transforms , it represents a compromise between many conflicting but desirable properties of image representation such as multi - scale and multi - orientation representation , locality both in space and frequency , and orthogonality resulting in decorrelation . A particularly suitable wavelet transform which forms the basis of the best denoising algorithms today is the over - complete steerable wavelet pyramid [ 4 ] freely downloadable from _CITE_ In our experiments we have confirmed that the best results were obtained using this wavelet pyramid .

Since this prior structure can be implemented using efficient algorithms that add negligible cost beyond standard inference techniques , we recommend it as a new standard for topic modeling . Topic models such as latent Dirichlet allocation ( LDA ) [ 3 ] have been recognized as useful tools for analyzing large , unstructured collections of documents . There is a significant body of work applying LDA to an wide variety of tasks including analysis of news articles [ 14 ], study of the history of scientific ideas [ 2 , 9 ], topic - based search interfaces _CITE_ and navigation tools for digital libraries [ 12 ]. In practice , users of topic models are typically faced with two immediate problems : First , extremely common words tend to dominate all topics . Second , there is relatively little guidance available on how to set T , the number of topics , or studies regarding the effects of using a suboptimal setting for T . Standard practice is to remove “ stop words ” before modeling using a manually constructed , corpus - specific stop word list and to optimize T by either analyzing probabilities of held - out documents or resorting to a more complicated nonparametric model .__label__Supplement|Website|Introduce

Because this test does not test independence of the samples , we include in the test statistic the Spearman ’ s rank correlation [ 38 ] of the residuals of the fit , ZS ( also distributed as a χi ) because if the residuals are correlated , the data are not independent . The p - value is thus computed by measuring how extreme K2 = Z2s + Z2k + Z2S is in the χ23 distribution ( with 3 degrees of freedom ). The implementation of this is available at _CITE_ In the population model , the calculation of the p - value must be different , because the variance is not being left as a free parameter , so we take a more classical approach . The p - value is computed by measuring how extreme is the difference between the data and its fit with respect to the difference between a sample from the model and its fit .__label__Method|Code|Produce

Although we did not find a direct negative relationship between evolutionary rate per se and evidence for competition ( S17 Fig ), there is a trend in the predicted direction , and together with estimates of disparity and divergence , our results are consistent with a model of evolution in which the impact of interspecific competition is negatively related to evolutionary rates : traits either evolve rapidly ( e . g ., under social selection ) and escape the effect of competition upon secondary contact , or they evolve slowly and thus are subject to the effect of interspecific competition in sympatry .

We assign each emoticon a label from the following set of labels : Extremely - positive , Extremely - negative , Positive , Negative , and Neutral . We compile an acronym dictionary from an online resource . _CITE_ The dictionary has translations for 5 , 184 acronyms . For example , lol is translated to laughing out loud .
