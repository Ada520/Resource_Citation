In this paper , the YAiTRON dictionary is exploited to assign the entity tags . YAiTRON : Yet Another ( Lex ) iTRON is a Thai - English and English - Thai dictionary data , stored in a wellformed XML format . YAiTRON is a homogeneous structure dictionary , adapted from National Electronics and Computer Technology Center ( NECTEC _CITE_ )’ s LEXiTRON dictionary . YAiTRON covers 32 , 350 unique words with 13 parts - of - speech i . e ., adjective ( ADJ ), adverb ( ADV ), auxiliary verb ( AUX ), classifier ( CLAS ), conjunction ( CONJ ), determiner ( DET ), end ( END ), interjection ( INT ), noun ( NOUN ), preposition ( PREP ), pronoun ( PRON ), question phrase ( QUE ), and verb ( VERB ). There are some tokens that always have only one PoS when beginning with some specific texts .__label__Material|Data|Extent

mating this lifetime , we hope it might be possible to form a link between the hidden states and the underlying physical process that governs the dynamics of switching . Despite the apparent limitation of Poisson statistics , it is a simple matter to generalize our model to hidden state distributions with long tails ( e . g ., power - law lifetime distributions ): By cascading many hidden states into a chain ( with fixed CIFs ), a power - law distribution can be approximated by the combination of multiple exponentials with different lifetimes .

Evaluations on four diverse tasks clearly show the model outperforms models without communication , fully - connected models , and models using discrete communication . Despite the simplicity of the broadcast channel , examination of the traffic task reveals the model to have learned a sparse communication protocol that conveys meaningful information between agents . Code for our model ( and baselines ) can be found at _CITE_ One aspect of our model that we did not fully exploit is its ability to handle heterogenous agent types and we hope to explore this in future work . Furthermore , we believe the model will scale gracefully to large numbers of agents , perhaps requiring more sophisticated connectivity structures ; we also leave this to future work .__label__Method|Code|Produce

In all the experiments that c - relaxation is used , the value of c is 0 . 01 . Note that our empirical study is focused on whether the proposed boosting algorithm is able to effectively improve the accuracy of state - of - the - art boosting algorithms with the same weak learner space W , thus we restrict our comparison to boosting algorithms with the same weak learners , rather than a wide range of classification algorithms , such as SVMs and KNN . We first compare DirectBoost with AdaBoost , LogitBoost , soft margin LPBoost and BrownBoost on 10 UCI data sets _CITE_ from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [ 8 ]. We partition each UCI dataset into five parts with the same number of samples for five - fold cross validation . In each fold , we use three parts for training , one part for validation , and the remaining part for testing .__label__Material|Data|Use

We proceed by discussing the details of the experimental design interleaved with our results .

We present the results for 5 pairwise classification tasks of varying difficulty and for odd vs . even digit classification .

The second , Cluster - Based LML ( CBLML ), is also a variant of PLML without weight learning . Here we learn one local metric for each cluster and we assign a weight of one for a basis metric Mbi if the corresponding cluster of Mbi contains the instance , and zero otherwise . Finally , we also compare against four state of the art metric learning methods LMNN [ 15 ], BoostMetric [ 13 ] _CITE_ , GLML [ 11 ] and LMNN - MM [ 15 ] . The former two learn a single global metric and the latter two a number of local metrics . In addition to the different metric learning methods , we also compare PLML against multi - class SVMs in which we use the one - against - all strategy to determine the class label for multi - class problems and select the best kernel with inner cross validation .__label__Method|Algorithm|Compare
The CMU pronouncing dictionary provides the phonemic representations of English pronunciations with a sequence of phoneme symbols . For instance , the English word KNOX is segmented and tagged as the phonemic representation < N AA K S & gt ;. Since the CMU pronouncing dictionary does not cover all the pronunciation information of the name entities in the training data , we also apply LOGIOS Lexicon Tool _CITE_ to generate the phonemic representations of all other name entities not in the CMU pronouncing dictionary . After obtaining the phonemic representation of all the English named entities in the training data , we formulate the sequence of phoneme symbols of the English name entities as a string and apply the substring alignment method mentioned earlier to get the mappings from English phoneme symbols to Korean letters . For the previous example , the phoneme symbols < N AA K S & gt ; from the English name entity KNOX are aligned to the letters of its corresponding Korean word “ nok sur ” as [ N → n , AA → o , K → k , S → sui ].__label__Method|Tool|Use

And finally , most experiments have been carried out on English paired with other European languages , and it is not clear whether the results translate across to other language pairs . In this research , we use the translations of MWEs and their components to estimate the relative degree of compositionality of a MWE . There are several resources available to translate words into various languages such as Babelnet ( Navigli and Ponzetto , 2010 ), _CITE_ Wiktionary , Panlex ( Baldwin et al ., 2010 ) and Google Translate . As we are ideally after broad coverage over multiple languages and MWEs / component words in a given language , we exclude Babelnet and Wiktionary from our current research . Babelnet covers only six languages at the time of writing this paper , and in Wiktionary , because it is constantly being updated , words and MWEs do not have translations into the same languages .__label__Method|Tool|Use
